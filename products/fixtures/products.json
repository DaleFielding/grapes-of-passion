It's a modern Spanish red that goes with everything, especially spicy barbecue meats or anything chargrilled.",

The winemaking team combine grapes from two very different regions to create something full but fresh. Monterey is known for its big Chardonnays, but Carneros is far cooler, so flavours are more understated. And you'll taste the benefits in this bold and buttery wine. It's silky smooth with fresh notes of citrus and vanilla. It's incredibly versatile, but we like it best with creamy tarragon chicken or soft, creamy cheese.",

White Burgundy is a go-to for Chardonnay drinkers, and the Mâconnais in particular offers great value. Unlike the northern Côtes, the southern part of Burgundy doesn't have a formalised vineyard hierarchy system. So the wines tend to be a bit more wallet-friendly. Not to mention, Lugny is one of the best regarded villages in the Mâcon, and Latour one of the most famous houses. Honeyed. Peachy. Crisp. A dream with salty finger foods or a classic Sunday roast chicken. It's proof that sometimes it pays to stick with the old favourites.",

That's exactly what you'll get with this wine, a textbook Californian Pinot Noir from the same winery which brought you the sell-out Bread & Butter Chardonnay. Their vineyards are ideally located for classic varieties like Pinot. It's sun-drenched, but cooled by the daily morning mists which roll in off the Pacific. It's exactly the sort of position that pernickety Pinot thrives in. This deliciously silky wine proves our point. It's all about red fruit. Cherries. Raspberries. Cranberries. It's seriously juicy and seriously delicious, with a nice fullness which is classic California. Oak ageing gives it a touch of cedary spice, and woody herb notes. Perfect with roast mushrooms.",

It's made from seven Grand Crus and only in the best years, when low-yielding Pinot Noir and Chardonnay vines produce perfectly ripe grapes. Rich and velvety, it has intense and complex notes of ripe citrus, golden apple and almond pastry with an incredibly long and elegant finish.",

In 1932 he did just that. The sale included some of the original vineyards which had been planted by Benedictine monks in the 1730s. And the rest is history. This is a classic Champagne, full of honeysuckle, brioche and pear flavours. Taittinger was Bond's Champagne of choice in the original novels, so try it with something equally sophisticated. We suggest cheese gougères, fresh from the oven.",
