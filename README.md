# Grapes of Passion

Website to be created for a fictional independent wine seller focused on enhancing the wine-buying experience with a user-friendly online platform. The website will offer easy navigation, detailed product listings, and secure shopping capabilities, ensuring an easy browsing and purchasing experience. Aiming to create a seamless and enjoyable way for consumers to explore and buy a selection of wines or book relevant experiences.

## Design

### Strategy

The strategy for this site is to include a wide range of features that users would expect for this type of website, as identified in the research below. I will also incorporate a darker, more passionate design to capture the company's essence and help it stand out from competitors.

#### Sites Researched:

-   [Averys](https://averys.com/)
-   [Laithwaites](https://www.laithwaites.co.uk/)
-   [The Great Wine Co.](https://greatwine.co.uk/)
-   [Kask](https://www.kaskwine.co.uk/)
-   [Cave Bristol](https://www.cavebristol.co.uk/)

#### General Findings:

-   Logos are typically in the top left, with a search function and cart icon in the top right.
-   Navigation includes dropdown menus for categories such as; Offers, Wine, Mixed Cases, Champagne & Sparkling, Subscriptions/Clubs, Gifts, About/About Us, Contact info, Events, and Reservations. These expand into subcategories.
-   Eye-catching background images or videos are common.
-   Incentives/offers are frequently displayed.
-   Products and categories are presented in grids and buttons further down the pages.
-   Clicking on the products will direct to a product details page, providing more information and option to add to cart/basket.
-   Viewing basket/checking out contains total, subtotal, delivery information and payment options.
-   When searching or selecting categories, further options are presented to filter/organise the displayed products.
-   Selecting events/reservations will inform users of dates and/or allow them to select available dates through a calendar/booking system.
-   Some sites display ratings, awards, and offer features such as chat support, newsletters, and blogs.
-   Footers include FAQs, delivery info, contact details, T&Cs, copyright, social links, and privacy policies.
-   Site styles are mostly bright/white with contrasting colours for emphasis.

Need to sort scope, have only copy and pasted it from Bonsay Bay, so far.

As some of these features extend beyond the necessary requirements for the project and may take more time than appropriate, I will not currently be implementing:

-   Ability to view/rate products
-   Subscriptions/loyalty points
-   Contact form
-   Blog
