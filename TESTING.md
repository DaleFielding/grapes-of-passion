# Testing

For this project, I started with Test Driven Development (TDD), writing tests before coding. Later, I switched to manual testing, which allowed me to find issues and improve usability that automated tests might miss. This also made it easier to adapt to changes and get quick feedback on the user experience. By using both TDD and manual testing, I ensured the application was well-tested and user-friendly.
